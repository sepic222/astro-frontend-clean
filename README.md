# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Tech Stack Overview

- **React** (v18) for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** for fast development, building, and previewing.
- **@vitejs/plugin-react** for React integration and Fast Refresh.
- **ESLint** for code quality and linting.

This setup delivers a lightweight, high-performance environment for modern React development with efficient builds and hot module replacement.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) and the [ESLint docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files#typescriptrules) for details.
